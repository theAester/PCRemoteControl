# PC Remote control

This is for when youre doing a fairly simple activity (eg: watching a movie/browsing the internet) and are sitting far from your computer. Now you can sit back in your armchair and control your computer with your phone. 

## Features

The currect app:

- has a functional touchpad which you can use to control the mouse cursor
- double-finger vertical/horizontal scrolling on the touchpad
- virtual keyboard typing
- Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Fn, Super, TAB, Caps, Del, Ins keys (as toggle or hold buttons)
- Volume and Brightness +/- keys as well as a mute key

## How to use

First make sure to check out the [server code](https://github.com/theAester/PCRemoteControl.git) and run it on your computer.
You will be presented with the a help message and the session Key in a pop up webpage. Insert the data into the mobile app in order to connect.
Once youre connected you should see the controls on your phones screen.

Please note that not all controls fit into the page. However scrolling has been disabled on the app to avoid interruptions while using the touchpad.
The controls have been carefully positioned according to possible need, in order to access the farther controls (bellow the screen limit) you'd have to use the designated "scroll" button instead.
